or

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/KoushikNavuluri/Claude-API.git

## Usage


Import the claude_api module in your Python script:

    from claude_api import Client

* Next, you need to create an instance of the Client class by providing your Claude AI cookie:

* You can get cookie from the browser's developer tools network tab ( see for any claude.ai requests check out cookie ,copy whole value ) or storage tab ( You can find cookie of claude.ai ,there will be four values )

* (Checkout below image for the format of cookie ,It is Better to Use from network tab to grab cookie easily )

      cookie = os.environ.get('cookie')
      claude_api = Client(cookie)

## List All Conversations

To list all the conversation Id's you had with Claude , you can use the list_all_conversations method:

    conversations = claude_api.list_all_conversations()
    for conversation in conversations:
        conversation_id = conversation['uuid']
        print(conversation_id)

## Query

To query Claude, you can use the query method. You need to provide the prompt and the conversation ID:

    prompt = "Hello, Claude!"
    conversation_id = "<conversation_id>" or claude_api.create_new_chat()['uuid']
    response = claude_api.query(prompt, conversation_id)
    print(response)

Also supported stream mode:

    prompt = "Hello, Claude!"
    conversation_id = "<conversation_id>" or claude_api.create_new_chat()['uuid']
    response = claude_api.query(prompt, conversation_id, stream=True)
    for r in response:
        print(r, end="")

## Query with attachment

You can send any type of attachment to claude to get responses using attachment argument in query().
Note: Claude currently supports only some file types.

{ You can also add timeout if you need ,using timeout parameter[default set to 500] }

    prompt = "Hey,Summarize me this document.!"
    conversation_id = "<conversation_id>" or claude_api.create_new_chat()['uuid']
    response = claude_api.query(prompt, conversation_id,attachment="path/to/file.pdf",timeout=600)
    print(response)

## Delete Conversation

To delete a conversation, you can use the delete_conversation method:


    conversation_id = "<conversation_id>"
    deleted = claude_api.delete_conversation(conversation_id)
    if deleted:
        print("Conversation deleted successfully")
    else:
        print("Failed to delete conversation")

## Chat Conversation History

To get the chat conversation history, you can use the chat_conversation_history method:    

    conversation_id = "<conversation_id>"
    history = claude_api.chat_conversation_history(conversation_id)
    print(history)

## Create New Chat

To create a new chat conversation (id), you can use the create_new_chat method:


    new_chat = claude_api.create_new_chat()
    conversation_id = new_chat['uuid']
    print(conversation_id)

## Reset All Conversations

To reset all conversations, you can use the reset_all method:


    reset = claude_api.reset_all()
    if reset:
        print("All conversations reset successfully")
    else:
        print("Failed to reset conversations")   

## Rename Chat

To rename a chat conversation, you can use the rename_chat method:

    conversation_id = "<conversation_id>"
    title = "New Chat Title"
    renamed = claude_api.rename_chat(title, conversation_id)
    if renamed:
        print("Chat conversation renamed successfully")
